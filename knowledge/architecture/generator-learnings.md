## C1 System Context - llm-switch

### Architecture Decisions and Rationale
- Created a proper C1 Context diagram following the Mermaid C4 Reference Guide exactly
- Used Person_Ext for external users (Developer, Operations Engineer) as they're outside the system boundary
- Used System for llm-switch as it's the system being designed
- Used System_Ext for all external dependencies (Nomad, Consul, Vault, Local Models, Frontier APIs, Observability Tools)
- All relationships use Rel() macro with proper labels and technology annotations
- Added PRD traceability comments in brackets after each element description
- Ensured diagram validates correctly with mmdc

### What Worked Well
- Following the C4 macro whitelist exactly prevented parsing errors
- Using UpdateLayoutConfig as the last line of the diagram
- Proper placement of System_Ext elements outside boundaries
- Clear, descriptive labels that match the narrative sections
- PRD traceability through inline comments

### Issues Addressed from Previous Attempt
- Fixed the file structure to start with H1 title, then immediately the Mermaid diagram
- Corrected element types (using System for llm-switch instead of System_Ext)
- Ensured all external systems have at least one labeled relationship
- Removed container/component elements that don't belong in C1
- Added proper PRD section references to all elements and narrative statements

### Domain Insights
- llm-switch acts as an intelligent proxy between developers/operations and various backend systems
- Core value is in real-time routing decisions based on complexity, latency, and cost
- Self-learning capability operates offline to improve routing without manual intervention
- Designed for Nomad cluster deployment with Consul/Vault integration
- Technology stack compliance: Golang, Docker, Nomad, Consul, Vault, vLLM, langfuse

### Mermaid/C4 Syntax Rules Confirmed
- Person_Ext for external actors
- System for internal system being designed
- System_Ext for external systems
- Rel() macro for all relationships with label and technology parameters
- UpdateLayoutConfig must be last line
- No -- or -> arrows allowed in C4 blocks
- All string arguments must use double quotes
- Labels with special characters must use HTML entities (though none were needed here)
