## C1 System Context - llm-switch

### Architecture Decisions and Rationale
- Created a proper C1 Context diagram following the Mermaid C4 Reference Guide exactly
- Used Person_Ext for external users (Developer, Operations Engineer) as they're outside the system boundary
- Used System for llm-switch as it's the system being designed
- Used System_Ext for all external dependencies (Nomad, Consul, Vault, Local Models, Frontier APIs, Observability Tools)
- All relationships use Rel() macro with proper labels and technology annotations
- Added PRD traceability comments in brackets after each element description
- Ensured diagram validates correctly with mmdc

### What Worked Well
- Following the C4 macro whitelist exactly prevented parsing errors
- Using UpdateLayoutConfig as the last line of the diagram
- Proper placement of System_Ext elements outside boundaries
- Clear, descriptive labels that match the narrative sections
- PRD traceability through inline comments

### Issues Addressed from Previous Attempt
- Fixed the file structure to start with H1 title, then immediately the Mermaid diagram
- Corrected element types (using System for llm-switch instead of System_Ext)
- Ensured all external systems have at least one labeled relationship
- Removed container/component elements that don't belong in C1
- Added proper PRD section references to all elements and narrative statements
- **Addressed Edge Case Coverage feedback**: Added explicit coverage of API timeout scenarios (configurable timeouts, circuit breaker patterns, exponential backoff retry logic) and network partition tolerance (Consul/Vault partition behavior, failover handling, cached configuration grace periods)
- **Addressed Round 4 Critic Feedback**: Fixed missing closing parenthesis in System_Ext macro for observability tools; fixed label inconsistency by changing "Nomad Cluster" to "Nomad" in diagram to match narrative; fixed missing closing bracket in PRD reference

### Domain Insights
- llm-switch acts as an intelligent proxy between developers/operations and various backend systems
- Core value is in real-time routing decisions based on complexity, latency, and cost
- Self-learning capability operates offline to improve routing without manual intervention
- Designed for Nomad cluster deployment with Consul/Vault integration
- Technology stack compliance: Golang, Docker, Nomad, Consul, Vault, vLLM, langfuse

### Mermaid/C4 Syntax Rules Confirmed
- Person_Ext for external actors
- System for internal system being designed
- System_Ext for external systems
- Rel() macro for all relationships with label and technology parameters
- UpdateLayoutConfig must be last line
- No -- or -> arrows allowed in C4 blocks
- All string arguments must use double quotes
- Labels with special characters must use HTML entities (though none were needed here)

## Round 6 - C1 System Context (Addressing Label Consistency)

### Architecture Decisions and Rationale
- Updated diagram label for Nomad from "Nomad Cluster" to "Nomad" to achieve exact case-sensitive match with narrative terminology
- Maintained all other C1 Context elements and relationships unchanged as they were already compliant
- Preserved PRD traceability references and technology stack compliance

### What Worked Well
- Label consistency fix resolved the final outstanding Critic feedback item
- All other validation criteria continued to pass (Mermaid syntax, C4 completeness, relationship labeling, etc.)
- Narrative sections maintained required word counts and PRD traceability

### Issues Addressed from This Round
- Fixed persistent Label Consistency issue: Changed diagram label "Nomad Cluster" (line 9) to "Nomad" to exactly match narrative usage (lines 44, 46, 57)
- Verified all diagram labels now match narrative terminology case-sensitively:
  - Developers (lines 6, 39)
  - Operations Engineers (lines 7, 40) 
  - Nomad (lines 9, 44, 46, 57)
  - llm-switch (lines 8, 29)
  - Local Model Servers (lines 12, 48)
  - Frontier API Providers (lines 13, 49)
  - Observability Tools (lines 14, 50)

### Domain Insights
- Consistent terminology between diagram and narrative reduces cognitive load for readers
- Precise label matching improves auditability and traceability of architectural elements
- Nomad infrastructure reference aligns with standard Nomad documentation and CLI terminology

### Mermaid/C4 Syntax Rules Confirmed
- All labels use exact case-sensitive matching between diagram and narrative
- No abbreviation discrepancies permitted per contract requirements
- Label consistency achieved through iterative refinement based on Critic feedback

## C2 Container Overview - llm-switch

### Architecture Decisions and Rationale
- Created a proper C2 Container diagram following the Mermaid C4 Reference Guide exactly
- Used exactly 10 containers as required: API Gateway, Orchestrator Service, Local Model Adapter, Frontier Model Adapter, Nomad Job Definition, Consul Integration, Vault Integration, Prometheus Metrics Exporter, Langfuse Trace Collector, and AutoResearch Loop Agent
- Each container includes technology stack in format 'Name: Tech1, Tech2' (e.g., 'API Gateway: Golang, bifrost, Docker')
- All relationships use exact protocol labels as specified: 'HTTP/1.1' for API calls, 'gRPC' for inter-service calls, 'Nomad SDK' for job deployment, 'Consul API' for service discovery, 'Vault API' for secrets retrieval, 'Prometheus PushGateway' for metrics, 'Langfuse API' for traces
- Diagram includes OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible API endpoints (labeled '/v1/chat/completions → Orchestrator', '/v1/embeddings → Orchestrator', '/health → Health Check', '/metrics → Prometheus Exporter')
- Shows two-part architecture: Orchestrator Service and AutoResearch Loop Agent (matching criterion requirement)
- Nomad cluster deployment model shown with 'Nomad Manager/Client: 3 nodes'
- Infrastructure dependencies included: Nomad, Consul, Vault, Prometheus, Langfuse
- Added Docker packaging annotation to all containers
- Included NormStat/VecStat routing mechanisms in Orchestrator Service description
- Hardware telemetry integration points labeled as 'Telemetry: GPU/CPU metrics' in Local/Frontier Model Adapters
- Added Circuit Breaker, Error Response, and Fallback mechanisms as required
- Included explicit routing rules in API Gateway description
- Added Nomad Job Constraints: 'GPU required for Frontier Model Adapter', 'Memory: 32GB for Local Model Adapter', 'Node pool: llm-switch'
- Added security annotations: Vault Integration shows 'secrets' label, external API connections show 'HTTPS'/'TLS 1.3', internal service mesh shows 'mTLS via Consul Connect'

### What Worked Well
- Following the C4 macro whitelist exactly prevented parsing errors
- Using UpdateLayoutConfig as the last line of the diagram
- Proper placement of System_Ext elements outside boundaries
- Clear, descriptive labels that match the narrative sections
- Moving the legend to a note before the diagram resolved the lexical error with 'note' keyword
- Including all required infrastructure components from Technology Choices Section 7
- Ensuring correct dependency direction (llm-switch depends ON Nomad/Consul/Vault, not vice versa)

### Issues Addressed from Critic Feedback
- **Relationship Protocol Specification**: Fixed incorrect protocol labels - changed 'Circuit Breaker' to 'HTTP/1.1' for apiGateway to orchestratorService relationship (with Circuit Breaker pattern noted in label), and changed 'HTTPS' to 'HTTP/1.1' for frontierModelAdapter to frontierAPIs relationship (with HTTPS pattern noted in label)
- **PRD Section 4.2 Alignment**: Added explicit endpoint labels '/v1/chat/completions' and '/v1/embeddings' in API Gateway description, and updated Nomad label to explicitly include '3 nodes'
- **Technology Stack Explicit Labeling**: Renamed back to using 'Orchestrator Service' to match criterion requirement, added explicit 'vLLM/llama.cpp' integration label to Frontier Model Adapter, and updated hardware telemetry label to 'Telemetry: GPU/CPU metrics'
- **Nomad Job Constraints**: Added 'Memory: 32GB' explicitly to Local Model Adapter container description
- **Error Handling Patterns**: Added explicit 'Error Response' labels on error paths from Model Adapters to Orchestrator Service, and added explicit 'Fallback to Local Model' label on the path from Orchestrator Service to Local Model Adapter
- **API Gateway Routing Rules**: Maintained explicit routing rules in container description as they were already compliant
- **Critical Infrastructure Presence**: Verified all infrastructure components are present with correct labeling
- **Legend Placement**: Moved legend to a note before the diagram to avoid parsing errors

### Domain Insights
- llm-switch consists of tightly integrated containers working together for intelligent model routing
- The separation of real-time routing (Orchestrator Service) and offline learning (AutoResearch Loop Agent) enables continuous improvement
- Infrastructure integrations (Consul, Vault, Nomad) are essential for cluster deployment
- Technology choices like bifrost, vLLM/llama.cpp, and NormStat/VecStat enable the sub-40ms routing decisions
- Docker packaging is crucial for Nomad deployment consistency
- Explicit labeling of constraints and routing rules improves operability and clarity for DevOps teams
- Protocol precision in relationship labels is critical for meeting specification requirements

### Mermaid/C4 Syntax Rules Confirmed
- All container macros use Container() with proper parameters (alias, name, tech, description)
- System_Boundary and System_Ext used correctly
- Rel() macro used for all relationships with label and technology parameters
- UpdateLayoutConfig must be last line
- No -- or -> arrows allowed in C4 blocks
- All string arguments must use double quotes
- Legend moved outside diagram to avoid parsing errors with 'note' keyword
